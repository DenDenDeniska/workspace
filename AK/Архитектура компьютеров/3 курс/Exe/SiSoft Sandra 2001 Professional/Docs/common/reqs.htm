<B>Note:</B> You don't have to have all this. But, generally the more you have the better. Most new computers have all this stuff anyway and you can get the software.
<P>
If you update your software or hardware you'll notice new information that you did not see before. Unlike other programs, Sandra only shows you available information so make sure you have the latest stuff.
