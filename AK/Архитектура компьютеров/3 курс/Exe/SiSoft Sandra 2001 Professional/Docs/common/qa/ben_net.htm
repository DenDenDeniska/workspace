<B>Q: I get <i>Packet too large for Network/Host</i> error<BR>
A:</B> Sandra uses 64Kb blocks to test the transfer rate. Some interfaces do not support packets this large, but only smaller packets. You can try the following:
<P>

<UL>
 <LI>Try the latest network drivers from the network card manufacturer. In most cases the built-in Windows drivers are scaled -down versions.
 <LI>Check the driver settings - there may be a setting to allow large packet fragmentation or change max. packet size.
 <LI>If you've used a <i>modem speed booster</i> make sure you've changed only the dial-up settings and not the LAN settings too. Go back to the defaults and/or clear all the settings from the registry.
 <LI>As a last resort, try a clean install of Windows. This seems to work in most cases.
</UL>
<P>

<B>Q: I get <i>Cannot get IP address of host</i> error<BR>
A:</B> Go to a console and try to ping the host by name. If you cannot, make sure DNS/WINS is correctly set up, otherwise enter the host names and their IP addresses in the HOSTS file.
<P>

<B>Q: Why are there no workgroups/domains visible?<BR>
A:</B> Check that you've set your computer to be part of a workgroup or the correct domain and that you're running the Microsoft Networks Client.
<P>

<B>Q: Why are there no computers on the domain/workgroup?<BR>
A:</B> Check that the network settings are correct. Try to connect to some of the computers you know should be on the network or ping them.
<P>

<B>Q: Why is my computer not listed in the domain/workgroup?<BR>
A:</B> There would be no point benchmarking the local interface, thus your computer is not shown if the workgroup/domain it is in is selected.
