<B>Q: What does Sandra stand for?<br>
A:</b> It stands for <B>S</B>ystem <B>AN</b>alyser, <B>D</b>iagnostic and <b>R</b>eporting <b>A</b>ssistant.
<P>

<B>Q: I read somewhere that <i>Sandra</i> was packaged along with the full version of Windows 98. I've checked my CD but see no indication.<BR>
A:</B> No, Sandra has not been bundled with Windows 9X yet. (<i>no we haven't made this up - this question is genuine</i>)
<P>

<B>Q: When will Sandra be phased out?<BR>
A:</B> We will support it as long as the Windows 9X kernel is alive and kicking. As NT takes over and Windows 2000 replaces Windows 9X Sandra will be phased out. From the launch of Windows 2000 there will be no new functionality added; any changes will deal only with hardware & software compatibility.
<P>

<B>Q: Isn't a name like <i>Sandra</i> daft for a program? Whatever possessed you to choose such a name?<BR>
A:</B> It's supposed to be an acronym. Well, we did &quot;stretch&quot; it a bit to make it sound better. This is not the first program to have a female name, remember Apple Lisa, Miranda, Microsoft Mum, Brenda, etc. There are more...
<P>
Have a look at these alternative names suggested (by users):

<UL>
<LI>Admin's Best Utility (ABU)
<LI>Admin's System Analyst Program (ASAP)
<LI>Admin's Computer Diagnostics (ACD)
<LI>Doctor Adrian's Computer Diagnostics Tool (DACDT)
<LI>The Diagnostics Tool Without Name (DTWN)
</UL>

<B>Q: Does the name &quot;Sandra&quot; have anything to do with someone with the same name (maybe a famous person)?<BR>
A:</B> Famous no; person, maybe.
<P>

<B>Q: Should I call Sandra &quot;it&quot; or &quot;her&quot; (or
&quot;him&quot;)?<BR>
A:</B> If that's your only problem then you're lucky&#133;
<P>

<B>Q: Can I get Sandra's source code for free?<BR>
A:</B> No.
<P>

<B>Q: Will you be releasing the code for Sandra as Samantha takes over?<br>
A: </B>No.
<P>

<B>Q: I have some DOS system analyzer which shows way more information than Sandra. Why can't you do that?<BR>
A:</B> Well, ask them why they haven't written a Windows version yet. Win32 programming is even harder and you can't do what you want like in DOS. Some stuff is just not relevant in Windows. Also, quite a few Windows analyzers are still 16-bit, Sandra is not.
<P>

On the other hand, a DOS analyzer could be better than a Windows analyzer if you check/test hardware at low-level. To check the Win16 sub-system a 16-bit analyzer could do better, too. The choice is yours.
<P>

<B>Q: I have (e.g. Norton Utilities '9X, Nuts &amp; Bolts) and I think that their sys info (e.g. Norton SI/32, Discover Pro)
is much better. Can't you do better than that?<BR>
<B>A:</B></B> If we could, some software company (Microsoft, Symantec) would have snapped us up a long time ago&#133; However, we do think that Sandra does things that SI does not do, but overall it can't compete. Also remember that NU is a package and not a stand-alone product. Seen anything you like?
<P>

<B>Q: What's the best overall information tool in your opinion?<BR>
<B>A:</B></B> Must be Discover Pro from Nuts &amp; Bolts (former Hurricane). While memory compression programs are utter crap, it has the best diagnostic tool we've ever seen. Pity it is still 16-bit.
<P>

<B>Q: I think that MS-Info is better than Sandra.<BR>
A:</B> Are you a troll? No way!
<P>

<B>Q: God! When Sandra crashes it takes Win95 with it. Where's the robustness I've read/heard so much about?<BR>
A:</B> Well, we always say that if you do something, you
might as well do it properly&#133; On a serious note, things are
getting very complicated down here, so watch out&#133;
<P>

<B>Q: How soon does Sandra get updated?<BR>
A:</B> Every 2-4 months.
<P>

<B>Q: What's this bunny thing in Sandra?<BR>
A:</B> If you haven't found it, don't worry about it. The <i>bunny</i> existed in Windows 3.0, 3.1, 3.11 and 95 - it was Microsoft's idea. SAW also had a bunny, so Sandra needed one too... Bunnies are fluffy and cute... and bad... Bad Bunny!
