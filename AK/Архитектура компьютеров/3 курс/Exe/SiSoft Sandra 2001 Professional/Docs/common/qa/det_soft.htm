<B>Q: Sandra tells me that the SAN16.EXE (SiSoft Sandra Support) module/process is obsolete! Is this true?<BR>
A:</B> No. The version information of this module is 3.1 instead of 4.0 for compatibility with Windows NT. Theoretically
it is considered obsolete but practically there is no other way. NT does not support new type 16-bit programs.  Update to Sandra version 4.20 or later.
<P>

<B>Q: Some 32-bit programs are shown as 16-bit in version information. Is this a bug?<BR>
<B>A:</B></B> When Sandra uses the version checking APIs it does not check itself the type of file it is dealing with. Microsoft <I><B>forgot</B></I> to update the version information of some Windows 95 applications (Media Player, Sound Recorder, etc.) to say that they are now 32-bit not 16-bit.
<P>

<B>Q: Processor load shows 100% during CPU benchmark. Is this correct?<BR>
A:</B> Yes! If this is lower some other programs are also using the CPU and you'll get lower scores.
