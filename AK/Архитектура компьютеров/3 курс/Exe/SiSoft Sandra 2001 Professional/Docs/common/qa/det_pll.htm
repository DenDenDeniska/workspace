<P>

<B>Q: Does Sandra support the clock generator of my mainboard?<BR>
A: </B>The clock generator is supported only if the following are true:
<P>

<OL>
<LI>The mainboard is known, thus the PLL IC is known <b>or</b> PLL IC can be auto-detected.
<LI>The mainboard SMBus/i2c controller is detected and enabled.
<LI>The PLL IC is actually connected to the SMBus/i2c bus.
<LI>The PLL IC supports read-back.
<LI>The PLL IC is supported. See the <A HREF="../compat.htm">Compatibility Document</A> for the list of supported chips.
</OL>
<P>

<B>Q: Sandra 2000 did detect my PLL IC. Sandra Me/2001 does not. Why?<BR>
A: </B>If the mainboard is not on our list, the PLL IC may not be supported. You can try forcing PLL IC detection by right-clicking module, select <i>Options</i> and uncheck <i>do not attempt to detect unknown PLL IC</i>.
<P>

<B>Q: PLL IC detection locks up my computer completly! Why and how do I fix it?<BR>
A: </B>Your PLL IC is write-only. See <A HREF="det_chip.htm">Chipset Q & A</A> for more information.
<P>

<B>Q: Why doesn't Sandra detect PLL ICs natively?<BR>
A: </B>Only the very latest PLL IC chips can be autodetected. The older ones cannot - most cannot be detected at all!
<P>

<B>Q: Sandra detects my PLL IC incorrectly!<BR>
A: </B>Go to module <i>Options</i> and turn <i>Auto Detect PLL IC</i> off. If this does not help, contact us.
<P>

<B>Q: Why does Sandra support so few clock generators?<BR>
A: </B>The reasons are quite a few:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Only modern clock generators (since around 1997) are software programmable.
<LI>Most clock generators are write-only (e.g. the entire IC-Works line). This means that the bus speed can be changed but it cannot be detected. This is not a problem for programs like SoftFSB but it is critical for Sandra.
</UL>
<P>

<B>Q: Sandra does not detect the PLL IC of my mainboard!<BR>
A: </B>PLL ICs (unlike other SMBus/i2c devices) cannot be detected. This is because there are no ID registers and most are write-only. One of the few possible ways is to do it by mainboard type. If Sandra does not know what your board uses, have a look and <A HREF="../contact.htm">let us know</A>.
<P>

<B>Q: Sandra does detect the PLL IC type but cannot find it.<BR>
A: </B>There are various reasons why this can happen:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Sandra does not detect the SMBus/i2c controller or the controller has locked.
<LI>The PLL IC is not at its known address or it is write-only.
<LI>The PLL IC has locked. 
</UL>
<P>

<B>Q: Sandra does detect the PLL IC and reads it fine, but I get no useful information.<BR>
A: </B>If the speed selected is <i>by hardware</i> then no useful information can be inferred. Only if the chip is software programmed useful information can be read back.
<P>

<B>Q: How can I modify the FSB by software?<BR>
A: </B>Sandra is an analyser not a PLL IC programmer. You can use programs like <A HREF="http://www.h-oda.com" TARGET="_top">SoftFSB</A> to program the PLL IC.
