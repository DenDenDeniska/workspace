<B>Q: Sandra is linked to missing export in MFC42. Program crashes<BR>
Q: Sandra does not start at all<BR>
A: </B>This means the MFC42 (Microsoft Class) libraries are not up to date. A Properties on the MFC42.DLL file in \Windows\System (use <b>Start - Find</b> if you cannot find it) should return a version of 6.00.8168.0 or later (preferably 6.00.8267.0). Try <b>one</b> of the following:

 <LI>Windows 95. Download <b>Windows Library Update</b> patch from <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/Default.asp">Updates for Windows 95</a>
 </OL>
<LI>Download and install <A HREF="../../san_dem/html/dload.htm">Sandra Standard 99</a> (in a different folder) and then uninstall it. The installer is more advanced and should be able to install the updated libraries.
<LI>In anger, you can try installing <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.htm">Microsoft Internet Explorer 5</A> or later.
<LI>We can e-mail them to you. This is riskier since you just copy them rather than going through a proper update. Also the file is rather large.
</OL>
<P>

<B>NB 1:</B> We have received reports that the patches are not updating the system libraries correctly. In this case delete it from your drive and try again. Try a different option if one option fails.
<P>

<B>NB 2:</B> If you're successfully updated the libraries (check whether the version matches), you may have to update other system libraries as well - see the issues below.

<B>Q: SANDRA caused an invalid page fault in module MFC42.DLL. Program crashes<BR>
Q: Sandra does not start at all<BR>
A: </B>This means the ComCtl32 (common controls) libraries are not up to date. A Properties on the ComCtl32.DLL file in \Windows\System (use Find if you cannot find it) should return a version of 5.80 or later (product version 5.00.2014.216). Try <b>one</b> of the following:

<P>

<B>NB 2:</B> We've also learned that some patches do not contain the latest version of the system libraries as we have thought - depending on download server. Try a different option if one option fails.

<B>Q: Some programs from the Tools menu are missing!<BR>
A:</B> These programs are <B>not</B> included in the package. They either come with Windows or you need to download them. To find out - click <B>F1</B> after you've selected the menu option or start by clicking the <B>Help</B> button on the toolbar and then select the menu option.<BR>
<P>

<B>Q: Sandra Professional Patch says <i>Version & Type does not match any known version</i><BR>
A: </B>Uninstall <b>All</b> copies of Sandra. Install a fresh copy of the Professional version. Try to patch it again.
<P>

<B>Q: When I try to patch nothing is downloaded and the program exits<BR>
Q: When I try to patch a small (1K) file is downloaded and I get "program is invalid".<BR>
A: </B>Look into the temporary folder for a file called <b>Update.exe</b>. If the file is small, open it with Notepad (hold <i>Shift</i> key and right-click, choose <i>Open With</i> and select Notepad). The file may contain a web error which was not caught by Sandra. The error message should identify the actual error.
<P>

<B>Q: Sandra has a problem with the Internet! (WININET)<BR>
A: </B>Uninstall Sandra. If you have MS-IE 4.0 or later installed, you may need to reinstall IE. If not, delete the WININET.DLL file in the <B>\Windows\System</B> folder. Then reinstall Sandra. Sandra will install a fresh copy of this library.<BR>
