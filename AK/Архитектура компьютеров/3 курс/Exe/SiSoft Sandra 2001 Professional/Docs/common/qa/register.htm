<B>Q: How do I register/purchase Sandra Professional?<BR>
A: </B>See <a href="../../sandra/html/order.htm">Ordering Information</a>.
<P>

<B>Q: I just bought Sandra Professional. Do I need to register?<BR>
A: </B>No, you're automatically registered when you buy the program.
<P>

<B>Q: &lt;some&gt; feature does not work!<BR>
A:</B> Check out the Standard version thoroughly before ordering. It is WYSIWYG - it's similar for the other modules. Also, modules that don't work/are unavailable do not appear in either version.
<P>

<B>Q: Why can't I still register for free for the Professional version 2.xx?<BR>
<B>A:</B></B> There are many various reasons, it's up to you to make up your own mind. Lack of funds, loss of free web &amp; e-mail accounts, almost no donations, almost no help. It was either to try to turn to real <i>shareware</i> or let it die. Since we can always try the latter we've chosen the former.
<P>

You can, however, use the Professional version <B>1.10</B> using the code ID <B>7070</B> (as promised). For the latter 1.xx versions use the code <B>19248</B>.Check the documentation for more information. Remember this is valid up to (not including) version 2.00 - does not include any later patches.
<P>

<B>Q: Why can't I use the old registration code in the Professional version 2.xx? <BR>
<B>A:</B></B> There is no registration code in version 2.xx. The Register Wizard has been removed together with all ancillary resources. So you cannot register this way anymore - the full version and the shareware executables are different.<BR>
<P>

<B>Q: Is there a code-generator for Sandra?<BR>
<B>A:</B></B> Yes, for version 1.10. It does not work with versions 1.16 or later. Will never work with 2.xx or later since there are no keys to generate. Don't ask for help in finding it, it's illegal. There is no excuse for using it - Standard version gives you around 80% of all modules for free.
<P>

<B>Q: Is there a crack for Sandra?<BR>
<B>A:</B></B> No, and we don't think there will be one. The code for the modules is simply not there. There are no nag screens, time-limits or run limits so there's nothing to crack.
